          “Our clients tell us that a fancy-looking written evaluation report at the end of a project is not enough.
          They want strong evaluation services that go beyond documenting performative outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          They want their staff, stakeholders, and project beneficiaries to be invested in the evaluation journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          What they want is an evaluation framework and tools that are conducive to self-reflection, dialogue,
          and systems thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          What they need is evaluation for transformational outcomes.“

          Verapax is a small, boutique consultancy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Verapax was founded by Angela Contreras, Director and Principal Consultant. Our work is informed by our lived experiences of being racialized by mainstream society and navigating systemic barriers to justice, equality, diversity and inclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          We service small to mid-sized not-for-profit organizations and institutions of teaching and learning. We work with our clients to develop organizational leadership and evaluative thinking throughout the processes of designing, implementing, and evaluating their initiatives.         </p>
