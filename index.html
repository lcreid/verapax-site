          “Our clients tell us that a fancy-looking written evaluation report at the end of a project is not enough.
          They want strong evaluation services that go beyond documenting performative outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          They want their staff, stakeholders, and project beneficiaries to be invested in the evaluation journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          What they want is an evaluation framework and tools that are conducive to self-reflection, dialogue,
          and systems thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          What they need is evaluation for transformational outcomes.“

              <li>Verapaz – Region in Guatemala known for its leafy millenary forests, with ecosystems typical of
                rainforests. Two Mayan symbols of peace and healing are found in the Verapaz region:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The Monja Blanca (White Nun) is a species of orchid. It is an epiphyte flower which means that while
                  it
                  does grow on other plants, mostly trees, it does not hurt their growth and grows in harmony with the
                  other
                  plant.

            <p>
              Verapax’s approach to independent consulting services follows Indigenous principles of Respect, Relevance,
              Reciprocity, Responsibility, and Relationships (5 Rs) to participatory, collaborative, empowering, and
              transformational project management, research & evaluation, teaching & learning.

            <p>
              We service small to mid-sized not-for-profit organizations and institutions of teaching & learning. We
              work with our clients develop their organizational leadership and evaluative thinking throughout the
              processes of designing, implementing, and evaluating their initiatives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our work is informed by our lived experiences of being racialized by mainstream society and navigating
              systemic barriers to justice, equality, diversity and inclusion.
