              One of the main inspirations for our name is where we come from, where we were born, and where our
              ancestors were born.

              <li>True peace. Peace and truth.</li>
              <li>Verapaz – Region in Guatemala known for its leafy millenary forests, with ecosystems typical of
                rainforests. Two Mayan symbols of peace and healing are found in the Verapaz region:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The Monja Blanca (White Nun) is a species of orchid. It is an epiphyte flower which means that while
                  it
                  does grow on other plants, mostly trees, it does not hurt their growth and grows in harmony with the
                  other
                  plant.</li>
                <li>The resplendent quetzalli (Nahuatl) or Quetzal is a bird of iridescent green or golden-green wing
                  coverts, back, chest and head, a red belly, and large tail feathers.</li>
