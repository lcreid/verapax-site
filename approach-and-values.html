              One of the main inspirations for our name is where we come from, where we were born, and where our

              <li>Verapaz – Region in Guatemala known for its leafy millenary forests, with ecosystems typical of
                rainforests. Two Mayan symbols of peace and healing are found in the Verapaz region:</li>
              <ul>
                <li>The Monja Blanca (White Nun) is a species of orchid. It is an epiphyte flower which means that while
                  it
                  does grow on other plants, mostly trees, it does not hurt their growth and grows in harmony with the
                  other
                  plant.</li>
                <li>The resplendent quetzalli (Nahuatl) or Quetzal is a bird of iridescent green or golden-green wing
                  coverts, back, chest and head, a red belly, and large tail feathers.</li>

          Angela M. Contreras<br />
          <small>Owner, Director, Principal Consultant</small>
        </h3>
        <p class="biography-text">I have a life-long commitment to causes of social justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI), locally
          and globally. My trans-disciplinary university formation (legal anthropology, criminology, inter-faith
          dialogue, international justice, sociology, and adult education) has equipped me with a unique skill-set I
          have used to advocate for reforms to law and social policies in support of access to public education and
          community support services for people with precarious income and migration status.
        </p>
        <p class="biography-text">As a scholar and practitioner, I have extensive experience working with non-governmental organizations,
          non-profits, and academic institutions in Canada, the USA, Guatemala, Thailand, and the Netherlands. As
          independent project management, research and evaluation consultant, I have worked with a wide range of
          clients to meet their needs around designing, implementing, and/or evaluating programs and services that can
          help overcome systemic injustices and inequalities.
        </p>
        <p class="biography-text">I am committed to continued training and education. I hold post-graduate certificates in Applied Project
          Management (Langara), Participatory Monitoring & Evaluation (UofOttawa & Mosaic), Monitoring & Evaluation
          applied to the Prevention of Crime and Violence (CESC, UChile), and Evaluation for Social Change &
          Transformative Learning (SFU).
