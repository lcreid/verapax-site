  <h3>Indicators</h3>
  <div class="underline w-100 mb-2"></div>
  <p>Indicators are the quantifiable measures of progress towards the intended inputs, outputs, outcomes and impacts
    of
    a
    project, program or strategy. They can be used to promote development outcomes when understood and supported among
    a
    broad range of stakeholders.</p>
  <p>Our monitoring and evaluation responds to todayâ€™s results-based and performance indicators culture. In that
    context,
    we can help our clients develop SMART indicators that help measure the qualitative and quantitative impact of
    projects, programs, organizations.</p>

  <h3>Training and Support</h3>
  <div class="underline w-100 mb-2"></div>
  <p>Verapax can provide formal or informal training to our customers looking to develop their own M&amp;E capacity.
    There
    is evidence that development programs work best when adapted to the local governance, structure, professional
    capacity
    and evaluation culture.</p>
