        Angela M. Contreras<br />
        <small>Owner, Director, Principal Consultant</small>
      </h3>
      <p class="biography-text">I have a life-long commitment to causes of social justice, equity, diversity, and
        inclusion (JEDI), locally
        and globally. My trans-disciplinary university formation (legal anthropology, criminology, inter-faith
        dialogue, international justice, sociology, and adult education) has equipped me with a unique skill-set I
        have used to advocate for reforms to law and social policies in support of access to public education and
        community support services for people with precarious income and migration status.
      </p>
      <p class="biography-text">As a scholar and practitioner, I have extensive experience working with non-governmental
        organizations,
        non-profits, and academic institutions in Canada, the USA, Guatemala, Thailand, and the Netherlands. As
        independent project management, research and evaluation consultant, I have worked with a wide range of
        clients to meet their needs around designing, implementing, and/or evaluating programs and services that can
        help overcome systemic injustices and inequalities.
      </p>
      <p class="biography-text">I am committed to continued training and education. I hold post-graduate certificates in
        Applied Project
        Management (Langara), Participatory Monitoring & Evaluation (UofOttawa & Mosaic), Monitoring & Evaluation
        applied to the Prevention of Crime and Violence (CESC, UChile), and Evaluation for Social Change &
        Transformative Learning (SFU).
