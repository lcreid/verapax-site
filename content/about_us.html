        Angela M. Contreras<br />
        <small>Owner, Director, Principal Consultant</small>
      </h3>
      <p class="biography-text">I have a life-long commitment to causes of social justice, equity, diversity, and
        inclusion (JEDI), locally
        and globally. My trans-disciplinary university formation (legal anthropology, criminology, inter-faith
        dialogue, international justice, sociology, and adult education) has equipped me with a unique skill-set I
        have used to advocate for reforms to law and social policies in support of access to public education and
        community support services for people with precarious income and migration status.
      </p>
      <p class="biography-text">As a scholar and practitioner, I have extensive experience working with non-governmental
        organizations,
        non-profits, and academic institutions in Canada, the USA, Guatemala, Thailand, and the Netherlands. As
        independent project management, research and evaluation consultant, I have worked with a wide range of
        clients to meet their needs around designing, implementing, and/or evaluating programs and services that can
        help overcome systemic injustices and inequalities.
      </p>
      <p class="biography-text">I am committed to continued training and education. I hold post-graduate certificates in
        Applied Project
        Management (Langara), Participatory Monitoring & Evaluation (University of Ottawa & Mosaic), Monitoring &
        Evaluation
        applied to the Prevention of Crime and Violence (CESC, UChile), and Evaluation for Social Change &
        Transformative Learning (SFU).

        Karla Contreras<br />
        <small>Associate Consultant</small>
      </h3>
      <p class="biography-text">
        Karla uses her expertise in research methodologies, group facilitation, and project management to inspire
        others to work towards their goals. Storytelling for social change and community development are some of her
        major topics. She helps communities and organizations tell their stories of transformational journeys so that
        these become something insiders and outsiders want to belong to.

        facilitating programs for youth programs in Thailand, New York, and Guatemala. She is a sociologist from the

        learn, learn to play”) methodologies.
      </p>

        In addition to being a researcher and facilitator, Karla is also an international youth advocacy officer. In
