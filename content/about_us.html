        inclusion (JEDI), locally
        and globally. My trans-disciplinary university formation (legal anthropology, criminology, inter-faith
        dialogue, international justice, sociology, and adult education) has equipped me with a unique skill-set I
        have used to advocate for reforms to law and social policies in support of access to public education and
        community support services for people with precarious income and migration status.
      </p>
      <p class="biography-text">As a scholar and practitioner, I have extensive experience working with non-governmental
        organizations,
        non-profits, and academic institutions in Canada, the USA, Guatemala, Thailand, and the Netherlands. As
        independent project management, research and evaluation consultant, I have worked with a wide range of
        clients to meet their needs around designing, implementing, and/or evaluating programs and services that can
        help overcome systemic injustices and inequalities.
      </p>
      <p class="biography-text">I am committed to continued training and education. I hold post-graduate certificates in
