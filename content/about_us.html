  <h3>Director / Directrice / Directora</h3>
  <p>In addition to founding the company, Angela is also director, chief consultant, and - since she operates the
    company
    out of her home office – she is the kitchen cleaner and the fair-trade coffee maker too. But far from being a
    one-woman show, Verapax is as big or as small as its clients need it to be. We assemble project teams to suit the
    scale and needs of the task at hand. These teams are drawn from a network of partners in a range of complementary
    fields -- from socio-legal non-governmental organizations, to professionals in quantitative and qualitative
    research,
    facilitation, project management, evaluation, IT consulting and a number of other specialties.</p>
  <p>Verapax is also frequently called upon by non-profit organizations that cannot afford to have a permanent full-time
    researcher, coordinator or evaluator for their programs and services. Because it is a small independent firm,
    Verapax
    can partner with any service provider, consultant, or agency, and services are fast, flexible, and cost-effective.

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Angela started Verapax in 2005 after a successful career spearheading academic and non-profit human rights and
    development projects in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, and before that in the Global South. She also led
    successful research and teaching initiatives at the School of Criminology and the Department of Sociology &amp;
    Anthropology at Simon Fraser University and at Université Saint-paul in Ottawa. Angela holds degrees in Cultural
    Anthropology, Inter-faith Dialogue and Social Movements, and Criminology.</p>
  <p>A self-described research and analysis “geek," Angela has always been fascinated by the intersection between the
    interests and needs in the non-for profit sector. Particularly: the consideration one needs to give to the dynamics
    between profit organizations, the community they work with, and the interests of funding agencies. Angela looks at
    the
    mission and vision of non-profit organizations, the programs and services they deliver, the impact of the
    organization
    on the communities, the interests of funding agencies and the ways effective non-profit organizations make these
    intersections happen. Angela background and experience in the non-profit sectors are supplemented by her
    post-graduate
    certificates in Applied Project Management (CAPM) and Planning-Monitoring &amp; Evaluation (PME) specializing in
    community development. And with the advice and help of some very talented BC-based consultants, Angela realized that
    there was a career to be made helping non-profits plan, manage and evaluate successful programs and services. </p>
