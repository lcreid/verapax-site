    <div class="underline w-100 mb-2"></div>

    <p>
      Social change and Systems Mapping: When you are confused about what a system is or how your organization or
      project interacts with it, a map of a system helps you:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Identify the pieces and key stakeholders that form the systems of your environment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Define how those pieces and stakeholders are inter-connected to form an interdependent system.
      </li>
      <li>
        Find ways to influence the pieces and stakeholders to change and/or inter-connect differently to create
        transformational, sustainable, systemic change.
      </li>
    </ul>
