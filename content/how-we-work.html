  <h3 class="text-center">How We Work</h3>
  <p>
    We service small to mid-sized not-for-profit organizations and institutions of teaching & learning. We
    work with our clients to develop their organizational leadership and evaluative thinking throughout the
    processes of designing, implementing, and evaluating their initiatives.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our work is informed by our lived experiences of being racialized by mainstream society and navigating
    systemic barriers to justice, equality, diversity and inclusion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our methodologies follow principles and values that are inspired in the work of scholars Archibald’s (2008)
    Storywork, Tuhiwai-Smith’s (2012) Decolonizing Research, Kirkness and Barnhardt’s (1991) 4Rs, and Parent’s
    (2014) 5th R.
  </p>
  <p>
    We comply with the
    <a href="https://www.afn.ca/uploads/files/nihbforum/info_and_privacy_doc-ocap.pdf">First Nations Principles of OCAP™</a>
      (ownership, control, access, and possession), which
    means that First Nations control data collection processes in their communities.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are guided by the professional
    <a href="https://evaluationcanada.ca/program-evaluation-standards">standards</a>
    and
    <a href="https://evaluationcanada.ca/ethics">guidelines</a>
    of the Canadian Evaluation Society.
